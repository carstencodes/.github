# How to contribute

Open Source Software always comes for free and is developed mainly in the free-time of the developers and maintainers. Please respect this when submitting issues or changes. Be respectful and consider that answers and fixes may take their time.

## Issues

We always strive to create feature-complete, bug-free and usable software. This cannot be guaranteed at any time. If you encounter an issue, feel free to submit it at any time.

If possible,

- describe your usecase / workflow
- provide information about your environment and the run-times you are using
- provide logs and error-messages, if applicable

In most cases, we may provide issue templates that guide you through the creation of issues. Please follow them as precise as you can.

## Discussions

If you feel unsure if you experience an issue or have trouble using the software, feel free to open an discussion. 

Discussions may be disabled on a project. If this is the case, there are other ways of contacting the developers, e.g. via matrix, discord, discourse, etc.

Please be patient and polite while we are trying to help you. Refer to the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information.

## Submitting changes

If you want to submit changes, like bug-fixes or new features, feel free to do so.

Ideally, open an issue first (bug description or feature request) that describes more of your use case.

Please don't feel offended, if we suggest or request changes. Some changes may not fit into our style or the way the software works.

In some rare cases, these parts do not apply to the direction of the software. Please accept, that some issues might not be accepted.

Your changes might be so extensive, that some automatic tests might be required in order to proof them to work. Please add tests on free will or on request.

## Coding conventions

The coding conventions fit the style of the author, which may not always be suitable for the mass. This may be enforced by styling rules during pull requests or as pre-commit checks.

These checks should be respected and conducted before submitting changes. For details, refer to the local project description in the ReadMe file.

## Testing

It is always good to see, that software is malfunctioning when the application changes. Hence, we should have tests. It should be visible, if a test carries out, what the actual behavior should be like and detect that it changes.

## Improving documentation

After an discussion has been solved, we might find, that the documentation is not that detailed as it should be. Contributions to the documentation are always welcome. Typically, we only foster the user documentation more than the documentation of the technical aspects. Nevertheless, both are important. Please take this into account, when contributing to the documentation.
